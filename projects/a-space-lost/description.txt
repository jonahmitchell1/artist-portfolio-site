A SPACE LOST
A visual exploration of ‘Lost’ as a quality or description, what makes something feel lost. A series of images connected by a imaginary, utopian world.
Consistent blue buildings, green floors and red accents give the sense of moving through a city, linked by architectural elements. Guided by indication of past events through recurring objects that give hints to a narrative, an unknown story of someone, or of those who inhabit the city.
