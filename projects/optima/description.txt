*****warning of flashing images*****
An experimental animation piece driven by the medium of scanography. Reflective surfaces, illustrations, old newspaper pages and trinkets are used to explore light and physical space through the use of a flatbed scanner.
These objects are reinterpreted through their refracted components to reveal aesthetic qualities that are absent to the human eye. Individual scans are stitched together in frame animations, attempting to make sense of - and give life to - the common unpredictability of this process of image-making. A collaboration between human and computed input.
EXHIBITED AT:   Tranas at the Fringe, Film Festival, Sweden [July 2022]
music: August by Tom la Haine
